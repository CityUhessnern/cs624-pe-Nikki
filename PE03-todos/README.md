# Input
This program accepts user text input to create a list of tasks. It also accepts touch input on several buttons: for each task, 
there are options to mark them as "Done" or Delete the task. There are also buttons on the tab at the bottom that enable touch
input to select either All Tasks, Active Tasks, or Completed Tasks. 
# Process
The program uses the submit button to add tasks to the end of the All Task List. The "Done" button removes a task from the 
Active Task List to the Completed Task List. The Delete button removes the task from all Task Lists. The All Task Tab switches 
from another Task Tab (Active or Completed) to the list of all task. The Active Task tab shows only Tasks not marked as Done.
The Completed Task list shows only tasks marked as done. 
# Output
The output is several differnt filterable task lists, with a text input box and a submit button.
