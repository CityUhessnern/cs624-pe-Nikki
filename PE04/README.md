# Input
This program creates profile thumbnails consisting of an image, a name, an occupation, and a description, and then also has actions upon touch input.
# Process
The processes in this program are largely around styling. There are several layers of contaier that impact the display of the profile thumbnails. Two flex containers are used to 
display the cards in six equal rows of three. There is a shadow, and on press, the cards either are enlarged or shrunk back to thumbnail size. 
# Output
I struggled with getting the profile cards to act independently, so the cards all expand or contract at once. They also clip within their containers. But there are six profile cards displayed
on the screen at the same time.
