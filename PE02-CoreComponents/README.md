# Input
This program consists mostly of static elements, which do not require user input. However, there is one textInput box
that asks for the user to input their favorite course.
# Process
This program includes a style sheet which expedites the formatting of the titles, which have a yellow background
and large bold text to separate those sections of text from the body text. The text from the input section just remains on the page, however the user decides to edit it, and is not connected to any database or other storage
mechanism. 
# Output
This program outputs a scrollable page, which includes an image, text and a text input box with default text,
and three sections, each beginning with its own title heading. These sections are different subtypes of courses 
within the Computer Science degree program at City University of Seattle, and the body text underneath the headings
include the courses that fall under that subtype.
