# hello-world README
## Input
This program requires no input, as it is static text on a yellow background.  

## Process
This program does not process any information, as it is static text on a yellow background.  

## Output
There is one view in the program, so far. This view contains three lines of text: my name, my major, and the abbreviation for the School of Technology and computing. It does this using three lines of React Native text that I set to font size 20, in order to enhance readability. The background is yellow, which I created by editing a stylesheet container. This is a very basic program meant to introduce us to the basic framework of React Native mobile app development.
